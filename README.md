# GEEHypso
Google Earth engine(GEE) code for data aquisition of  hypsometric analysis 
Digital Elevation Model and a polygon shapefile with basins and river networks. 

## Code Usage
The developed code can be directly imported to code editor of Google Earth Engine and modified for utilization. 

![GEE code Editor] (https://code.earthengine.google.co.in/)
Resources to be accessed from GEE using the code 
1. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of study area. 
2. Polygon shapefile with basins of study area
3. River Network details of study area. 

Once all the files are imported, the required study area shapefile can be overlayed on them by uploading the study area shapefile as an asset in GEE. 
Following which the extarcted and pre-processed DEM,River Basin details and stream network details can be downloaded for utilization.
